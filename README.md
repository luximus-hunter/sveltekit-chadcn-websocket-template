# SvelteKit chadcn websocket Template

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte). Includes [chadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) and websocket support out of the box.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run prodServer`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
